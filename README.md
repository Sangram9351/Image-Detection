# Image Forgery-Detection
In this project we check any forgery is done in image or not.
In this we use CNN to check it.
First we resize the image and then decrease the image pixels.
If there is forgery the its colours differnt then oher colour of image.
From different colour we can say that in this photo forgey is done.
